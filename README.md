# Kresky's GW2 Markers
Marker Pack for the Guild Wars 2 Addon [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/)

Currently only contains a Hero Point train for Heart of Thorns (Verdant Brink, Auric Basin and Tangled Depths).  
The path is designed with the idea that _anyone_ could follow as long as they have the Gliding Basics mastery (no other masteries needed aside from Itzel Poison Lore for 1 HP in Tangled Depths).  
That said, it does assume that the commander plays as a mesmer to provide portals, and especially has a Skyscale.
The route also includes various of markers that you can interact with to instantly copy a message to your clipboard, which can make commanding simpler.
