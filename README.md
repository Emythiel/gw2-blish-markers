# Kresky's GW2 Markers
Marker Pack for the Guild Wars 2 Addon [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/)

### Content:
- **Hero Point Train**  
A Heart of Thorns hero point route, designed for commanders leading a train through Verdant Brink, Auric Basin and Tangled Depths.  
The path is designed with the idea that _anyone_ can follow the commander, as long as they have at least the Gliding Basics mastery (no other masteries needed aside from Itzel Poison Lore for 1 HP in Tangled Depths).  
The route assumes that the commander plays as a mesmer to provide portals, and has access to majority of masteries (mainly Skyscale).  
Along the route there will be various of markers that can be interacted with to copy a message to your clipboard, so you can quickly let the squad know what to do.

- **Raid Info** *(Work in Progress)*  
Adds a "cheat sheet" before raid bosses, with basic information such as time between certain mechanics, how long they last, how big the defiance bars are, etc.
Mechanics are not explained in-depth, nor will there be any specific strategy guide, as they can change depending on updates, classes, squad composition and so on.  
Instead, think of it more like a little "ah right, X mechanic lasts Y seconds" - as in, little reminders on the smaller details that are more easily forgotten.
